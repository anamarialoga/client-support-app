'npm run dev' for starting both frontend and backend;

# CLIENT SUPPORT APP

- dotenv
- colors

* BACKEND

- Express

  - exception handler
- mongoose
  - object modelling tool which supports both promises and callbacks; creates the model for our collection, where we can find other documents from the same collection
- bcryptjs
  - hashing & checking passwords
- jsonwebtoken
  - generate tokens
- nodemon

* FRONTEND

- react-router-dom
  - use Router, Routes, Route, useNavigate(), etc.
- toastify

  - http requests , to avoid fetch()
- react-icons
- react-modal
- react-jwt
  - use decodeToken()
